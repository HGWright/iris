Citing Iris
===========

If Iris played an important part in your research then please add us to your
reference list by using the recommendations below.

IRIS can be cited directly from the GitHub repository.

The IRIS citation does not contain the version of the software used. We
recommend that you use the version number of the release you used, and the
commit hash of the version you used. This will allow others to reproduce the
environment that you worked in.

You can find what a citation should look like for a particular version of IRIS,
and where to find the citation on GitHub by looking at the `documentation GitHub
has for citing repositories. <https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files>`_
